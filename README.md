I'm a young eager recent graduate of Makers Academy, looking to collaberate and excel wiht others. I crave a workplace that I can fully immerse myself in, learn from and contribute to. I am keen to evolve the knowledge I've collected, and I believe if I can find the right environment I can continue this rapid progression.

While at Makers Academy I became fond of using React, as I believe it embodies a lot of coding principles, such as the single resposibilty principle and generally breeds clean code. I'd also like to learn more technologies to develop my stack and really take advantage of my seniors and peers knowledge, however I believe I also have the methodical approach needed to learn independantly. I enjoy working within a team, using Agile (scrum) methodologies to increase work flow and structure the devlopment process.

## Projects

|Name|Time(weeks)|Stack|Description|
|-------| --------- | ------- | ----- |
|[MakersRich](https://github.com/toddpla/makersrich)| 2| Javascript (React & Redux), Firebase, Jest, Cypress, HTML, CSS | A educational role play game, teaching up and coming coders the basics of Ruby and JavaScript, making use Firebase to enable realtime multiplayer. |
|[Acebook](https://github.com/rekapap/acebook-busy-politicians) | 2 | Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, HTML, CSS | A clone of Facebook, users are able to post to a feed or a user wall (much like facebook). Posts can then be commented on/liked etc. This was good practice for handling HTTP requests and loading HTML dynamically. |
|[MakersBnB](https://github.com/felixjtdb/MakersBnB) | 1| Javascript, HTML, CSS | A clone of AirBnB, being able to list a property with details such as location, etc and then a client being able to book that for certain dates.|

## Skills
#### Communication

Growing up as the youngest in a family of 7, I think it's fair to say I have strong soft skills. At Makers we embodied Agile methodologies, having frequent stand ups and retros, communicating about why we didn't meet estimations so that we can progress and improve on our errors for the next sprint. Stressful team dynamics can arise when under time constraints but with the right communication and encouragment, an intense work environment can produce the most gratifying results.

During my final project at Makers, we had the realisation that we had taken on a hefty workload and the deadline was rapidly approaching; seperating work streams as much as possible became a neccesity and having a holistic understanding of the code though communication and code review became second nature, I loved working on MakersRich. Peer feedback is huge at Makers and often in my feedback I would be told I made the work environment more enjoyable.
