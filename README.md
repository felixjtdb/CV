I'm a young eager recent graduate of Makers Academy, looking to collaberate and excel with others. I crave a workplace that I can fully immerse myself in, learn from and contribute to. I am keen to evolve the knowledge I've collected, and I believe if I can find the right environment I can continue this rapid progression.

While at Makers Academy I became fond of Javascript and particularly React, as I believe it embodies a lot of coding principles and generally breeds clean code. On the otherhand in a new environment, I'd love to learn more further develop my stack and really take advantage of the new seniors and peers that I will have around me. Thats not to say I cannot work independantly, I have the methodical approach needed to learn independantly. I enjoy working within a team, using Agile (scrum) methodologies to increase work flow and structure the devlopment process.

## Skills
### Communication

Growing up as the youngest in a family of 7, I think it's fair to say I have strong soft skills. At Makers we embodied Agile methodologies, having frequent stand ups and retros, communicating about why we didn't meet estimations so that we can progress and improve for the next sprint. Stressful team dynamics can arise when under time constraints, but with the right communication and encouragment I believe an intense work environment can produce the most gratifying results.

During my final project at Makers, we had the realisation that we had taken on a hefty workload and the deadline was rapidly approaching; seperating work streams as much as possible for productivity became a neccesity and having a holistic understanding of the code though communication and code review became second nature, I loved working on MakersRich. Peer feedback is huge at Makers and I'm told I make the work environment more enjoyable while still giving the project momentum and direction.

#### Meticulous and Methodical

When approaching a problem I instincively modulate and break it down so we have more achievable solutions. When blocked or lacking understanding, I have the compentance and drive to find the solution independantly, traversing the endless amounts of information there is on any given topic on the internet. I believe this skill is enhanced when in a team, being meticulous when reviewing code and being methodical when explaining or justifying your approach to others.

I have experience with test driven development, using a variety of testing frameworks - such as: Rspec, Cypress, Jest, Jasmine, unittest and Zombie. I understand the process satisfying user requirements with feature testing and creating minimilistic code through unit testing.
